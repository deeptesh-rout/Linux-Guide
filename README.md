[Zypper](https://software.opensuse.org/package/zypper) is a command line package manager which makes use of libzypp. It provides functions like repository access, dependency solving, package installation, etc. Zypper repositories are similar to the ones used in YaST, which also makes use of libzypp.

[Pacman](https://archlinux.org/pacman/) is a utility which manages software packages in Arch Linux. It uses simple compressed files as a package format, and maintains a text-based package database (more of a hierarchy), just in case some hand tweaking is necessary. 

[Arch Linux User Repository (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/) is a software repository that contains thousands build scripts, for compiling nearly 68,000 installable packages from source using the Arch Linux makepkg application.

### Linux Kernel

[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)

The Linux kernel is the main component of a Linux operating system (OS) and is the core interface between a computerâs hardware and its processes. It communicates between the 2, managing resources as efficiently as possible.

<p align="center">

  <br />
Linux kernel layout
</p>

**Categories for Linux Kernel Releases:**

* **Prepatch:** Prepatch or "RC(Realease Candidate)" kernels are mainline kernel pre-releases that are mostly aimed at other kernel developers and Linux enthusiasts. They must be compiled from source and usually contain new features that must be tested before they can be put into a stable release. Prepatch kernels are maintained and released by Linus Torvalds.
    
* **Mainline:** Mainline tree is maintained by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds). It's the tree where all new features are introduced and where all the exciting new development happens. New mainline kernels are released every 9-10 weeks.
    
* **Stable:** After each mainline kernel is released, it is considered "stable." Any bug fixes for a stable kernel are backported from the mainline tree and applied by a designated stable kernel maintainer. There are usually only a few bugfix kernel releases until next mainline kernel becomes available -- unless it is designated a "longterm maintenance kernel." Stable kernel updates are released on as-needed basis, usually once a week.
    
* **Longterm:** There are usually several "longterm maintenance" kernel releases provided for the purposes of backporting bugfixes for older kernel trees. Only important bugfixes are applied to such kernels and they don't usually see very frequent releases, especially for older trees. 

**Current Longterm release kernels**

### Systemd
[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)

[systemd](https://systemd.io/) is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system. It provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. systemd supports SysV and LSB init scripts and works as a replacement for [SysVinit](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SysVinit).

  <br />
Systemd Overview
</p>

[init](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init) is parent of all Linux processes with PID or process ID of 1. It is the first process to start when a computer boots up and runs until the system shuts down. **init stands for initialization**.

**After installation has completed, run the following command to reload the daemon in systemd.**

```$ systemctl --user daemon-reload```

**Disable PulseAudio in Ubuntu. It will no longer be needed, since we are using PipeWire.**

```$ systemctl --user --now disable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket```

**PulseAudio is disabled, we can start PipeWire and enable it to run automatically upon system boot.**

```$ systemctl --user --now enable pipewire pipewire-pulse```

**Run the following command to ensure that PipeWire is running.**

```$ pactl info```

### Reverting Changes

```$ sudo apt remove pipewire pipewire-audio-client-libraries gstreamer1.0-pipewire libpipewire-0.3-{0,dev,modules} libspa-0.2-{bluetooth,dev,jack,modules} pipewire{,-{audio-client-libraries,pulse,media-session,bin,locales,tests}}```

**Reload the daemon in systemd.**

```$ systemctl --user daemon-reload```

**Re-enables the PulseAudio service after you do a system reboot.**

## Getting Started NixOS

[NixOS](https://nixos.org/) is a Linux distribution built on top of the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix). It has tools dedicated to DevOps and deployment tasks.

[Nix Tour](https://nixcloud.io/tour/) is an interactive tour that uses the actual package manager to learn you the language by example, in the browser.

[Nix](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix) is a package manager and build system that parses reproducible build instructions specified in the [Nix Expression Language](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_Expression_Language), is a pure functional language with lazy evaluation. Nix expressions are pure functions taking dependencies as arguments and producing derivation specifying a reproducible build environment for the package. Nix stores the results of the build in unique addresses specified by a hash of the complete dependency tree, creating an immutable package store that allows for atomic upgrades, rollbacks and concurrent installation of different versions of a package, essentially eliminating [dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell).

[Nix Expression Language](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_Expression_Language) is a pure, lazy, functional language. Purity means that operations in the language don't have side-effects (for instance, there is no variable assignment). The language is not a full-featured, general purpose language. Its main job is to describe packages, compositions of packages, and the variability within packages.

[Nixpkgs](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nixpkgs) is the largest repository of [Nix](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix) packages(over 80,000 packages) and [NixOS](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS) modules. The repository is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs) and maintained by the community, with official backing from the [NixOS Foundation](https://nixos.org/). Additionally, checkout [Language-specific package helpers](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Language-specific_package_helpers) and [Alternative Package Sets](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Alternative_Package_Sets).

[NixOS Packages Search](https://search.nixos.org/packages) is a tool for searching through NixOS packages.
