## Setting up PipeWire for Ubuntu/Debian

**Note:** For those using Pop!_OS 22.04 or later PipeWire is already setup by default.

**Add PipeWire PPA**

```$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pipewire-debian/pipewire-upstream```

**Install the pipewire-audio-client-libraries and additional libraries to use Bluetooth, GStreamer, or JACK devices with your Ubuntu/Debian system.**
 
 ```$ sudo apt update```
  ```  $ sudo apt install pipewire pipewire-audio-client-libraries gstreamer1.0-pipewire libpipewire-0.3-{0,dev,modules} libspa-0.2-{bluetooth,dev,jack,modules} pipewire{,-{audio-client-libraries,pulse,media-session,bin,locales,tests}}```

**After installation has completed, run the following command to reload the daemon in systemd.**

```$ systemctl --user daemon-reload```

**Disable PulseAudio in Ubuntu. It will no longer be needed, since we are using PipeWire.**

```$ systemctl --user --now disable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket```

**PulseAudio is disabled, we can start PipeWire and enable it to run automatically upon system boot.**

```$ systemctl --user --now enable pipewire pipewire-pulse```

**Run the following command to ensure that PipeWire is running.**

```$ pactl info```

### Reverting Changes

```$ sudo apt remove pipewire pipewire-audio-client-libraries gstreamer1.0-pipewire libpipewire-0.3-{0,dev,modules} libspa-0.2-{bluetooth,dev,jack,modules} pipewire{,-{audio-client-libraries,pulse,media-session,bin,locales,tests}}```

**Reload the daemon in systemd.**

```$ systemctl --user daemon-reload```

**Re-enables the PulseAudio service after you do a system reboot.**

```$ systemctl --user --now enable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket```

**Ensure that PulseAudio has been completely restored.**
 
```$ pactl info```

## Getting Started NixOS

[NixOS](https://nixos.org/) is a Linux distribution built on top of the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix). It has tools dedicated to DevOps and deployment tasks.

[Nix Tour](https://nixcloud.io/tour/) is an interactive tour that uses the actual package manager to learn you the language by example, in the browser

[Nix](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix) is a package manager and build system that parses reproducible build instructions specified in the [Nix Expression Language](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_Expression_Language), is a pure functional language with lazy evaluation. Nix expressions are pure functions taking dependencies as arguments and producing derivation specifying a reproducible build environment for the package. Nix stores the results of the build in unique addresses specified by a hash of the complete dependency tree, creating an immutable package store that allows for atomic upgrades, rollbacks and concurrent installation of different versions of a package, essentially eliminating [dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell).

[Nix Expression Language](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_Expression_Language) is a pure, lazy, functional language. Purity means that operations in the language don't have side-effects (for instance, there is no variable assignment). The language is not a full-featured, general purpose language. Its main job is to describe packages, compositions of packages, and the variability within packages.

[Nixpkgs](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nixpkgs) is the largest repository of [Nix](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix) packages(over 60,000 packages) and [NixOS](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS) modules. The repository is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs) and maintained by the community, with official backing from the [NixOS Foundation](https://nixos.org/). Additionally, checkout [Language-specific package helpers](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Language-specific_package_helpers) and [Alternative Package Sets](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Alternative_Package_Sets).

[NixOS Packages Search](https://search.nixos.org/packages) is a tool for searching through NixOS packages.
